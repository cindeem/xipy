==============================
Nutmeg-Py Documentation System
==============================

This documentation system is created using reST_, a markup language
format, and Sphinx_, a docs generation utility written in Python_. The 
structure of these docs is largely copied from the example of the
NIPY_ project, which in turn adapted documentation code from Matplotlib_, 
pyMVPA_, and others.

In order to build the documentation, you must have Sphinx v0.5 or greater installed.

This directory contains:

* Makefile - the build script to build the HTML or PDF docs. Type
  ``make help`` for a list of options.

* users - the user documentation.

.. * devel - documentation for developers.

* faq - frequently asked questions

* api - placeholders to automatically generate the api documentation

.. * www - source files for website only reST documentss which should not
  go in the generated PDF documentation.

* links.txt - reST document with hyperlink targets for common
  links used throughout the documentation

* .rst files - some top-level documentation source files

* conf.py - the sphinx configuration.

* sphinxext - some extensions to sphinx to handle math, ipython syntax
  highlighting, numpy_ docstring
  parsing, and autodocs.

* _static - used by the sphinx build system.

* _templates - used by the sphinx build system.

* _py_api_tools - Python code used for automatic API docs generation

Building the documentation
--------------------------

.. Instructions for building the documentation are in the file:
.. ``devel/guidelines/howto_document.rst``

.. Since this README.txt is not processed by Sphinx during the
.. documentation build, I've included the links directly so it is at
.. least a valid reST doc.

.. .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. .. _reST: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. .. _numpy: http://www.scipy.org/NumPy
.. include:: links.txt
