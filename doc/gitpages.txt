This is the current workflow for rebuilding docs using gitpages

* Make changes in master doc tree
* Rebuild html (make html)
* Use sphinxtogithub tool to clean up _static, etc directory and references
* Do something like this:
``cd build/html && tar cvf ../../../html.tar * && cd ../../..``
* View pages, make edits, repeat
* When ready to check in new html, first commit to the master branch, then switch branches to gh-pages
``<git commit ... >``
``git checkout gh-pages``
* Add/commit/push new content
``<git add/commit>``
``git push origin gh-pages``
